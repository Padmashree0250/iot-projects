Here are few project examples designed for certain sensors such as DHT 11, Ultrasonic sensor, Touch sensor, Pulse sensor, IR sensors, and also other related topics like potentiometer, LDR, LCD, Servo motor, LED's, and also various Communitcation techniques. This projects are mainly designed on the ESP32 Dev board. I had choosed the Arudino IDE as a platform to excecute these projects.
